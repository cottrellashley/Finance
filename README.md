The code was all written by myself. However, I read the papers in full get the idea and some of the math.

A simple mode for calculating the diversification of a portfolio by maximizing the entropy of the portfolio.

The model finds a numerical solution by finding the optical maximum of both profits and etropy of a portfolio distribution based on the expected returns on each asset.
